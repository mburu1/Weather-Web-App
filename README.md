# Weather-Web-App
weather app that displays the current weather details based on the location entered by the user. We will be leveraging a common weather API to achieve this.  User will be presented with temperature, wind speed, likelihood of rain, and general weather i.e. Sunny, Raining, Cloudy etc.
